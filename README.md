# RML
## Development
The code is in Java (automatically generated by ANTLR) and Kotlin. Gradle is needed.

To build:

    $ ./compiler/gradlew build

To run:

    $ ./compiler/gradlew run

The executable JAR archive (including dependencies) is built in `compiler/build/lib`.

## Usage
The program currently reads a specification from standard input, parse it and prints the abstract syntax tree.
