# RML
## Development
The code is in Java (automatically generated by ANTLR) and Kotlin. Gradle is needed.

To build `cd` into `compiler` and type:

    $ ./gradlew build

To run:

    $ ./gradlew run

Or run the automatically generated executable JAR:

    $ java -jar build/libs/rml-compiler.jar

## Usage
The program currently reads a specification from standard input and outputs a Prolog program encoding the 
specification.
