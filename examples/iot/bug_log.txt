Bugs

2) whole event matching parsed but not translated correctly
et(obj) matches obj;
translated into
match(Event, et(Obj)) :- match(Event, obj).

Enhancements

1) support for constant `declarations' in 'with' constraints, to avoid complex expressions such as

-1 <= (temp2-temp1)/(time2-time1) && (temp2-temp1)/(time2-time1) <= 1
