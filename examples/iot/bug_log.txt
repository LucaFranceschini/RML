Bugs

1) variable 'event' not properly managed 
et(event) matches {event:event};

2) whole event matching parsed but not translated correctly
et(obj) matches obj;
translated into
match(Event, et(Obj)) :- match(Event, obj).

3) unary -, *, / and parentheses not supported in 'with' constraints

4) == in 'with' constraints translated with '==', '=:=' should be used

5) && in 'with' constraints not correctly translated: ,(Goal1,Goal2)  should be ','(Goal1,Goal2)

Enhancements

1) support for constant `declarations' in 'with' constraints, to avoid complex expressions such as

-1 <= (temp2-temp1)/(time2-time1) && (temp2-temp1)/(time2-time1) <= 1
